<p class="speech">Good evening, Katherine.</p>

<h5 class="name mrs_stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h5>
<p class="speech">Ah, good evening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!</p>

<h5 class="name peter_stockmann">Peter Stockmann.</h5>
<p class="speech">I happened to be passing, and so—<direction>looks into the dining-room</direction>. But you have company with you, I see.</p>

<h5 class="name mrs_stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h5>
<p class="speech">Oh, no—it was quite by chance he came in.</p>
<p class="direction">[Hurriedly.]</p>
<p class="speech">Won't you come in and have something, too?</p>

<h5 class="name peter_stockmann">Peter Stockmann.</h5>
<p class="speech">I! No, thank you. Good gracious—hot meat at night! Not with my digestion.</p>

<h5 class="name mrs_stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h5>

<h5 class="name peter_stockmann">Peter Stockmann.</h5>

<h5 class="name mrs_stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h5>
<p class="speech">Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are spendthrifts.</p>

<h5 class="name peter_stockmann">Peter Stockmann.</h5>
<p class="speech">Not you, my dear; I would never think that of you.</p>
<p class="direction">[Points to the Doctor's study.]</p>
<p class="speech">Is he not at home?</p>

<h5 class="name mrs_stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h5>
<p class="speech">No, he went out for a little turn after supper—he and the boys.</p>

<h5 class="name peter_stockmann">Peter Stockmann.</h5>
<p class="speech">I doubt if that is a wise thing to do.</p>
<p class="direction">[Listens.]</p>
<p class="speech">I fancy I hear him coming now.</p>
