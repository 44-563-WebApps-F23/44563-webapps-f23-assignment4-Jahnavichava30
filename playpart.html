        <b>Peter Stockmann.</b>
        Good evening, Katherine.
    <p>

    <p><b>Mrs. Stockmann.</b>
        Ah, good evening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!</p>

    <p> <b>Peter Stockmann.</b> I happened to be passing, and so—(looks into the
        dining-room). But you have company with you, I see.</p>

    <p><b>Mrs. Stockmann.</b> Oh, no—it was quite by chance
        he came in. (Hurriedly.) Won't you come in and have something, too?</p>

    <p><b>Peter Stockmann.</b> I! No, thank you. Good gracious—hot meat at night!
        Not with my digestion.</p>

    <p><b>Mrs. Stockmann.</b> Oh, but just once in a way</p>

    <p><b>Peter Stockmann.</b>
        No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and
        butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more
        economical, too.</p>

    <p><b>Mrs. Stockmann.</b> Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are
        spendthrifts.</p>

    <p> <b>Peter Stockmann.</b>
        Not you, my dear; I would never think that of you.
        (Points to the Doctor's study.) Is he not at home?</p>

    <p><b>Mrs. Stockmann.</b>
        No, he went out for a little turn after supper—he and
        the boys.</p>

    <p> <b>Peter Stockmann.</b>
        I doubt if that is a wise thing to do. (Listens.) I
        fancy I hear him coming now.</p>

    <p><b>Mrs. Stockmann.</b>
        No, I don't think it is he. (A knock is heard at the
        door.) Come in! (HOVSTAD comes in from the hall.) Oh, it is you, Mr.
        Hovstad!</p>

    <p><b>Hovstad.</b>
        Yes, I hope you will forgive me, but I was delayed at the
        printers. Good evening, Mr. Mayor.</p>

    <p><b>Peter Stockmann.</b>
        Good evening. You have come on business, no doubt.</p>

    <p><b>Hovstad.</b>
        Partly. It's about an article for the paper.</p>
